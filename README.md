Hi, I'm a post-doc in the Weisberg lab at Oregon State University working on plant-pathogen interaction. I've completed my Ph.D on Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics from University of California, Riverside. 

One major project I worked on during my Ph.D. research was competition of rhizobia during symbiosis. Check the paper here: Competitive interference among rhizobia reduces benefit to hosts.
